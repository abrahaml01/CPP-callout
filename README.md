# Help Me Code

A beginner in C++ who's only ever touched Python. i know the basics... basically up to the beginning of OOP, but struggling to remember specific functions, headers, etc... Working my way through Programming
Principles and Practice Using C++ - Bjarne Stroustrup

This repo is a little experiment: I want **you** to throw some tasks, challenges, mini-programs, or even ideas for tools/scripts at me — and I’ll try to code them (in C++).

I'm learning by doing, so whether it’s:
- A simple algorithm
- A basic console app
- Rewriting a bash tool in C++
- Or just something weird you’d like to see me attempt…

**Send it through.**

## How to Submit Stuff

Post a new [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/abrahaml01/CPP-callout/issues) with:
- A short title
- A clear description of what you want me to build or solve
- Any extra notes like input/output, constraints, or even rough pseudocode

### Good Example
> Write a C++ program that mimics the `head` bash command — prints the first 10 lines of a file.

### Not-So-Good Example
> make a game

(Too vague! Help me help myself.)

## What I'll Do

I’ll:
- Give it a go (in `/solutions`)
- Comment my code where I can
- Probably overthink simple things
- Learn from it either way
